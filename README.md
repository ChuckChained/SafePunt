Welcome to the safePunt github repository.

"Punt - Slang. to gamble, especially to bet on horse races or other sporting events."

This code is a clone of the infamous SafeMoon token. It changes multiple parameters as well as being intented to be deployed on the Conflux blockchain. One benefit of this chain is the low transaction fees and the ability to have all transactions by the contract sponsored by the foundation. This means all transactions with the contract during this grace period will be free to the end user.

I also experimented with a staking pool based on wrapping the native token to the Conflux chain (CFX).
Users can then stake the sCFX token in a farm where they receive a reward in the form of safePunt tokens.
This means that the token is liquidity mined over time and slowly is distributed to users.
